## Installation

### Prebuilt Images

Feature limited builds of the image are available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-limesurvey/pkgs/container/container-limesurvey) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nfrastack/limesurvey).

To unlock advanced features, one must provide a code to be able to change specific environment variables from defaults. Support the development to gain access to a code.

To get access to the image use your container orchestrator to pull from the following locations:

```
ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-limesurvey:(image_tag)
docker.io/nfrastack/limesurvey:(image_tag)
```

Image tag syntax is:

`<image>:<branch>-<optional tag>-<optional phpversion>`

Example:

`docker.io/nfrastack/container-limesurvey:latest` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-limesurvey:6-1.0` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-limesurvey:6-2.0-php84`



* `latest` will be the most recent commit

* `branch` will be the repositories branch, typically matching with the major version of LimeSurvey eg `6`

* An optional `tag` may exist that matches the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) - These are the safest

* An optional `phpversion` may exist like `php84` or `php83`

Have a look at the container registries and see what tags are available.

#### Multi-Architecture Support

Images are built for `amd64` by default, with optional support for `arm64` and other architectures.

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for your use.

* Map [persistent storage](#persistent-storage) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.


### Persistent Storage

The following directories/files should be mapped for persistent storage in order to utilize the container effectively.

| Directory   | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `/logs`     | Nginx and PHP Log files |
| `/www/html` | Limesurvey sourcecode   |


### Environment Variables
